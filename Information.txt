transcompilers/souce to source compiler
Compilation = syntactic and semantic analysis + Code optimization + Generate Machine Code

Why programs are platform dependent ?

	File Format used are different -
		Windows Executable File Format - PE (Portable Executable)
		Linux Executable File Format - ELF (Executable and Linkable File)
	System calls (eg - File Opening, Directory creation etc.) are different in Windos and Linux
	Different hardwares have different machine codes.
