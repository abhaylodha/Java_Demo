JAVA -
	General-Purpose
	Platform independent
	Object-Oriented
	High performant
	Multi-threaded
	Compiled as well as Interpreted 
		Compiled : Source Code -> Byte Code (compact and optimized code)
		Interpreted : Byte Code -> Machine Instruction executed

Some compilers are transcompilers, which does souce to source compilation.

Compilation = syntactic and semantic analysis + Code optimization + Generate Machine Code

Why programs are platform dependent ?

	File Format used are different -
		Windows Executable File Format - PE (Portable Executable)
		Linux Executable File Format - ELF (Executable and Linkable File)
	System calls (eg - File Opening, Directory creation etc.) are different in Windos and Linux
	Different hardwares have different machine codes.
 
JVM Responsibility
	Loads and interprets code
	Automatic memory management
	Security

JIT compilation -
	Also called as Dynamic Compilation.
	Most JVMs provide Just in Time compilation for higher performance.
	JVM identifies frequently executed code, called Hot Spots.
	JVM converts Hot Spot specific Byte Code to Machine Code.
	Machine Code is cached.
	It's not specified in JVM specification.

JVM is implemented by various companies by following JVM specifications.
	eg. -	Oracle's Hotspot JVM implementeation
		IBM's JVM

When we execute a program using "java <program>", it -
	creates a new JVM instance in memory and
	loads Hello.class in memory and
	executes it.


JAVA Software Family
	JAVA Standard Edition (For Desktop/Server Applications)
		Two versions
			1) JRE (Java Runtime Environment) = JVM + JAVA API (Standard Libraries)
			2) JDK (Java Development Kit) = Development tools + JRE
	JAVA Enterprise Edition (For Server Applications)
	JAVA Micro Edition (For Resource contrained devices)

Public classes should be written in it's own java file.
	public class HelloWorld1  -> Should be in HelloWorld1.java


Who created Java?
	James Gosling
Which of the following is correct statement about execution of a Java program?
	JAVA Program is compiled into Byte Code and Byte Code is executed by JVM.
An interpreter does not generate machine code like a compiler, but it maintains a library of pre-compiled
machine code and executes the appropriate machine code corresponding to the statement in the source code. True/False?
	True
What is a JIT compiler?
	It is a JVM component that perform dynamic compilation by converting frequently executed bytecode called "hot spots" into machine code.
	The compiled machine code is cached and used in future to achieve faster performance.
To compile and run Java programs, one needs to install ONLY a JRE. True/False?
	False
Why are we using public for only one class?
	Let's  assume we have two public classes Y & Z in a  file named Y.java.  Now, let's assume a different class X is using Z.
	Now, when we compile  X, the compiler first tries to locate Z.class and if it cannot find it,  then it tries to locate Z.java
	so that it can compile it automatically.  But, since we only have Y.java, the class Z  cannot be located and hence  we get a
	compilation error. So, we do need  to place them in separate  files.  

Statically Typed Language
	Variable can hold data of type which it is declared with. Type cannot be changed later. It is checked while compiling, so it's called as Static Type Checking.

	Good for detecting programming mistakes earlier.

Dynamically Typed Language
	Javascript is dynamically typed language, because variable can be assigned different types of values.

Literal means raw data.
	Eg. int a = 5;   // Here - 5 is literal
	boolean isHappy = true;   //Here - true is literal.

Static Variable = Class Variable. Only one copy for the class. Gets default values.
Instance Variable = Variables specific to each object and represents object state. Gets default values.
Local Variables = Within methods. They don't get default values. Must be initialized.

class member variables (Static + Instance) can have default values, but cannot be reinitialized within class body. It can be reinitialized within member methods.

Java Primitives :
  |
  |---boolean
  |
  |---Number
       |
       |---Integer
       |      |---Byte (8 bits) [Default value = 0]
       |      |---Short (16 bits) [Default value = 0]
       |      |---Int (32 bits) [Default value = 0]
       |      |---Long (64 bits) [Default value = 0]
       |
       |---Floating Type
       |      |---Float  (32 bits)  [Range : -3.4E38 to 3.4E38, Default value = 0.0f]
       |      |---Double  (64 bits) [Range : -1.7E308 to 1.7E308, Default value = 0.0d]
       |
       |---Character
              |---char  (16 bits, unsigned integer scheme) [Range : 0 to 2^16-1, Default value = '\u0000' (A null character)]

Why different types Integer Data Types ?
	To avoid memory wastage in resource contained devices. Programmer can choose best possible container as per requirement.

Integer data representation
	- Signed two's complement to represent data.

Floating data representation
	- IEEE 754 floating point specification to represent data.

Hexadecimal representation
	int y = 0x41;  //OR 0X41   It's hexadecimal 4 * 16^1 + 1 = 65.

int y = 0b01000001;     // Introduced in Java 7.   It's binary representation. 1*2^6 + 1 = 65.
int y = 0101;     //Octal.     1*8^2 + 1 = 65.
int y = 1_23_456;      //Introduced in Java 7. Used to improve readability.
int x=5, y=6;          // Two variables in a single statement can be declared and initialized.
int x,y=6;             // In class - x will be zero. In local scope, it needs to be initialized before using.
int x=y=99;           // y ifirst reassigned to 99 and then x is declared with value 99.

    class $ClassStartingWithDollarSign {
	   int x = 20;                   //x is declared as isntance variable.
	   int y = x = 99;               //x can be re-initialized in this way as it is a declaration statement for y.
	}

	float f = 23.4f;    //f is required for floats.
	double d = 37.4d;	//d is optional for double.

Avoid float and double if exact answers are required.

Use Bigecimal for monetary calculations (E-Commerce applications).

Doubles are more precise.

Java uses UTF-16 format to represent all characters.

char c = 65;		//In Unicode 65 maps to 'A'.

char c = '\u0041'   // Unicode is Hexadecimal number. So 4*16^1 + 1 = 65. so maps to 'A'.
char c = 0x41       // 4*16^1 + 1 = 65. so maps to 'A'.
char c = 0b01000001       // 2*2^6 + 1 = 65. so maps to 'A'.
